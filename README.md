### Advent of Code

This is my hacks for Advent of Code 2020 https://adventofcode.com/2020

* I write each file to solve part 1 and modify it to solve part 2.
  * Each files is therefore a spoiler    
* I sometimes then tidy it
* I don't write to be elegent solutions - i'm after quick and dirty ones.
* The input here is mine - it's different for each person
* And I barely write python, but I like to use it for these sorts of things to try and learn a bit more each time.
